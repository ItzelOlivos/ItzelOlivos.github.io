I"√<p>The United States-Mexico Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchange (COMEXUS) invited me to share experiences and tips to navigate the admission process with the 2020 generation of Fulbright scholars.</p>

<p>I also had the chance to help Dr. Seiichi Matsuda (Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies at Rice University) promote Rice University‚Äôs programs.</p>

<p>This adventure concluded with a trip to Teotihuac√°n, a majestic archaeological site located in the State of Mexico (the place where I was born üòÅ).

<p>(UPDATE 2022) Nowadays, climbing the pyramids at Teotihuac√°n is prohibited, but there are many new and exciting activities: dining inside a cave, making chocolate from scratch, riding four-wheelers, flying in hot air balloons and, of course, seeing first-hand ‚ÄúThe City of the Gods,‚Äù the most important and largest city of pre-Aztec central Mexico. So, if you travel to Mexico City, don‚Äôt forget to visit <a href="https://www.visitmexico.com/en/estado-de-mexico/teotihuacan">Teotihuac√°n</a>!
