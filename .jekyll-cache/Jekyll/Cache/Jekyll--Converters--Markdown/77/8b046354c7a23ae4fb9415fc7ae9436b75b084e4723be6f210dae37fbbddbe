I"h<p>This program at Rice University allows undergrads to work with faculty members and graduate students on research projects.</p>

<p>This summer, I helped mentor Jessica Opsahl-Ong, a student from the Computer Science Department. I also joined a discussion panel where other fellow graduate students and I tried to convince the summer interns to pursue research careers.</p>

<p>To conclude the program, the interns presented their projects at the Smalley-Curl Institute (SCI) annual Summer Research Colloquium. Jessica’s project: “Determining mental model of agents playing the prisoners dilemma,” won the 2022 REU award!</p>
