<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We develop a version of stochastic control that accounts for computational costs in the brain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combining concepts of efficient coding with control theory, we analyze Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control. LQG is a well-understood mathematical example of optimal control that combines a Kalman filter to keep track of a hidden state with a linear regulator that minimizes integrated quadratic state and action costs. When the state dynamics are linear, and all noise sources are Gaussian, this combination is your best bet!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We implement the Kalman filter neurally using a dynamic Probabilistic Population Code <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, in which linear projections of spiking neural activity approximate the natural parameters of a Gaussian posterior over the world state. To this framework, we add a cost on the total integrated number of spikes used to encode the probability distributions.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Past studies have identified metabolically efficient ways of coding sensory evidence, but they are restricted to feedforward settings. It is also important to understand the consequences of closed-loop control.</li>
  <li>This work provides a foundation for a new type of bounded rational behavior that could be used to explain suboptimal computations in the brain.</li>
  <li>Understanding the mechanisms that give biological organisms an advantage over machines when it comes to perception and mobility can help engineer robots that are more robust, general-purpose, and energy efficient.</li>
