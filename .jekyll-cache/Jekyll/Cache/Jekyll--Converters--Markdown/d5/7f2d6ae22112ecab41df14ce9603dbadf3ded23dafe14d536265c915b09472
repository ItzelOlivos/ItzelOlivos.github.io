<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This project is a web scrapper that collects data from Google Scholar and returns a network of collaboration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given a list of Google Scholar users that you can customize, the scrapper recursively collects information about their co-authors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information retrieved is organized into a graph whose nodes represent authors and edges represent publications in common.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The size of the node represent its ‚Äúbetweeness centrality‚Äù, a measure that indicates the number of shortest paths passing through the node. The higher this number, the more influence the author has over the network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The color of the node denotes the author‚Äôs affiliation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use plotly (a very useful tool to display data in python) to generate interactive graphs. You can rotate the graph, zoom in and out, and learn more about the authors‚Äô research interests by hovering over the nodes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I used this network to find my PhD advisor! Dr Xaq Pitkow is a very active member of the scientific community working on topics such as control theory, machine learning, and theoretical neuroscience.</li>
