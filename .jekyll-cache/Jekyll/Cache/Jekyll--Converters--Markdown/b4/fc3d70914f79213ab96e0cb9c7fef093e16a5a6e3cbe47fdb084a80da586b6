I"£<p>This summer I became a mentor at Riceâ€™s REU program.</p>

<p>This program allows undergrads to work with faculty members and graduate students on research projects.</p>

<p>I helped mentor Jessica Opsahl-Ong, a student from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I also joined a discussion panel where other fellow graduate students and I shared our experiences as research assistants with the summer interns.</p>

<p>To conclude the program, the interns presented their projects at the Smalley-Curl Institute (SCI) annual Summer Research Colloquium. Jessicaâ€™s project: â€œDetermining mental model of agents playing the prisoners dilemma,â€ won the 2022 ECE/REU award!</p>
