I"<p>Neuromatch Academy is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide high-quality training in Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience.</p>

<p>Over the last three years, I have helped create interactive demos to help students learn about hidden Markov models and control theory, caption video lectures in Spanish to increase accessibility, and clarify questions during live sessions.</p>

<p>The 2022 tutorials are ready and free for anyone who wants to learn!</p>
