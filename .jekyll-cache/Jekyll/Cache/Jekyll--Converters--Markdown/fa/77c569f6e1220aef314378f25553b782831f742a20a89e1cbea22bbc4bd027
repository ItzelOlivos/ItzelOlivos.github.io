<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This project solves a multi-agent control problem involving collision avoidance and tracking under uncertainty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scenario: A group of smart devices (green dots) need to track an entity (yellow arrow) while coordinating to avoid collisions among themselves and with a moving threat (red dot).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To avoid the moving threat and following the target, the devices compute consensus-based estimates of the threat and target’s positions using data collected locally (by its own sensors) and via neighbor-to-neighbor communication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To follow the target and avoid collisions, the devices use Flocking. This is a form of collective behavior that emerges from local interactions of a large group of agents with a common objective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="take-away">Take away</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Centralized approaches entail significant communication overheard and rely heavily on the performance of a single device (central node).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hierarchical communication strategies (devices share information using a tree structure) help, but the associated risk of relying too much on the central node remains.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Linear consensus algorithms require minimal computation, communication, and synchronization to compute averages of local quantities (for example, estimates of a target’s position).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flocking is an efficient algorithm to compute collaborative control policies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Distributed methodologies like this one can help minimize the communication and computation consumption of devices forming Wireless Sensor Networks, a technology with applicability in a wide number of monitoring applications (wildfire tracking, transportation surveillance, study of natural phenomena, etc.)</li>
</ul>
