The United States-Mexico Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchange (COMEXUS) invited me to share experiences and tips to navigate the admission process with the 2020 generation of Fulbright scholars.

I also had the chance to help Dr. Seiichi Matsuda (Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies at Rice University) promote Rice University's programs. 

This adventure concluded with a trip to Teotihuac치n, a majestic archaeological site located in the State of Mexico (the place where I was born 游때).

(UPDATE 2022) Nowadays, climbing the pyramids at Teotihuac치n is prohibited, but there are many new and exciting activities: dining inside a cave, making chocolate from scratch, riding four-wheelers, flying in hot air balloons and, of course, seeing first-hand "The City of the Gods," the most important and largest city of pre-Aztec central Mexico. So, if you travel to Mexico City, don't forget to visit [Teotihuac치n](https://www.visitmexico.com/en/estado-de-mexico/teotihuacan)!
