On this unforgettable day, I officially became a Fulbright-Garcia Robles scholar!

The Fulbright-Garcia Robles program supports students (Mexican and American) who wish to carry out postgraduate studies, research, or teaching in the neighboring nation. The program is sponsored by the governments of both countries and seeks to generate better understanding and bilateral cooperation through the exchange of culture, education, and knowledge. 

The United States-Mexico Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchange ([COMEXUS](https://www.comexus.org.mx)) administers this scholarship in Mexico. The Commission conducts a rigorous selection process that considers academic excellence and leadership potential. Once selected, the recipients receive mentorship throughout the application process in up to five universities, invitations to participate in seminars that help overcome the upcoming culture shock, and stipends of up to $25,000 annually. 

Thanks to the Fulbright-Garcia Robles scholarship, I will be able to specialize in computational neuroscience and contribute to the development of more robust and general-purpose Artificial Intelligence systems. 

If you are interested in applying for a Fulbright-Garc√≠a Robles scholarship and have questions of any kind, feel free to contact me! I will be happy to help üòÅ
