Neuromatch Academy is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide high-quality training in Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience. 

Over the last three years, I have helped create interactive demos to help students learn about hidden Markov models and control theory, caption video lectures in Spanish to increase accessibility, and clarify questions during live sessions.

The 2022 tutorials are ready and free for anyone who wants to learn!
