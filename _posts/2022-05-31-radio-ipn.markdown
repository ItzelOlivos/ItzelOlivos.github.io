IPN Radio kindly invited me to share my experiences as a PhD student in the USA. During the interview, 
I had the opportunity to chat about resilience, the importance of selecting a supportive advisor over prioritizing a prestigious university, 
resources that can help Mexican students in maximizing their chances of acceptance at a university in the USA, 
and the joy of being paid to study something you're passionate about.
