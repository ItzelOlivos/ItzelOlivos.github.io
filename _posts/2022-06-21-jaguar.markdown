Huichol art is a unique form of traditional Mexican craftwork originating from the Huichol or Wix√°rika indigenous people of Mexico. 
It is renowned for its vibrant colors, intricate designs, and symbolic representations deeply rooted in Huichol culture and spirituality.
The art primarily involves the use of small, brightly colored beads meticulously applied onto various objects such as sculptures, 
masks, bowls, and ceremonial items. 
Fascinated by this magical style, I embarked on this project, pouring nine months of passion into it. From molding the jaguar to meticulously placing each bead, it's been quite the journey!
