This summer I became a mentor at Rice's REU program.

This program allows undergrads to work with faculty members and graduate students on research projects.

I helped mentor Jessica Opsahl-Ong, a student from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I also joined a discussion panel where other fellow graduate students and I shared our experiences as research assistants with the summer interns. 

To conclude the program, the interns presented their projects at the Smalley-Curl Institute (SCI) annual Summer Research Colloquium. Jessica's project: "Determining mental model of agents playing the prisoners dilemma," won the 2022 ECE/REU award!
