I was honored to receive the Estado de Mexico Prize 2020, the highest public recognition given by the State of Mexico
across different fields, including science and technologyâ€” the category I was awarded in. I had a wonderful time 
meeting Governor Alfredo del Mazo and Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero. We had a great conversation 
about the importance of inspiring curiosity and fostering a passion for science starting at a young age.
